# Security notes

## Verify commands (`harness story verify` / `decision verify`)

Stories and decisions may set a `verify` frontmatter field: a **single-line shell
command** that the CLI runs with the project directory as `cwd`.

| Aspect | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Source of the command | Local Git-backed markdown (project authors / collaborators) |
| Who triggers execution | Operator running `harness story verify …` (or verify-all) |
| Shell | Yes — so common proof scripts work (`npm test`, `node -e "…"`, `&&`) |
| Hardening | Non-empty, max length, no null bytes / newlines; cwd must be a real directory; timeout + maxBuffer |

This is the same trust class as:

- CI workflow `run:` steps
- `npm test` / Makefile targets checked into the repo

**Do not** treat `verify` as a place for remote or unauthenticated input. If an
attacker can change committed story files, they can already change app source
and CI scripts.

Implementation: `src/infrastructure/verify.ts`.

## Update check (npm)

On most commands (not bare `--help` / `--version`), the CLI may check the public
npm registry for a newer `@vantanminh/harness` version.

| Behavior | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Frequency | At most one registry fetch per 24h (cache: `~/.harness/update-check.json`) |
| Effect | One-line **stderr** notice only; never blocks or changes exit codes |
| Fail-open | Network/errors are silent |
| Disable | `HARNESS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, or when `CI=true` / `CONTINUOUS_INTEGRATION` |
| Interval override | `HARNESS_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (milliseconds; tests/debug) |

No auto-upgrade is performed.
